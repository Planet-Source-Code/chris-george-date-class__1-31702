## Date Class


</div>

### Description

Hate doing math on dates? Well this code is for you! This class will do all of the math for you. I use to add those heavy calander controls to my projects just so I could use their fancy nextday, nextweek, and nextyear functions. So I decided to write a class that does all that and more. It has NextDay, NextWeek, NextMonth, NextYear, PreviousDay, PreviousWeek, PreviousMonth, PreviousYear and More! You can add increments of days, weeks or years by using the add and subtract functions. Lots and lots of comments and easy to use. Try it and let me know if it helps.
